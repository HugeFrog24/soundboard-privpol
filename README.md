# Privacy Policy

_Last Updated: Jan 29th, 2025_

Welcome to the Soundboard App developed by Tibik ("we," "us," "our", "me"). We are committed to protecting your privacy and ensuring you have a positive experience while using our app. This Privacy Policy explains how we handle your information in our Soundboard App, available on the Google Play Store. As our app is designed to entertain without compromising your privacy, please take a moment to understand our practices.

**1. Information We Collect**

The Soundboard App does not collect, store, or transmit any personal or non-personal information. The app requires internet access to download sound assets on demand, which keeps the initial app size small and allows us to deliver new content without requiring full app updates. No data is ever uploaded from your device.

**2. How We Use Information**

Since our app does not collect any information, there is no use of personal or non-personal data within the app.

**3. Sharing of Information**

We do not have any information to share or disclose to third parties as the app does not collect any data.

**4. Data Security**

The app's design ensures your privacy by never collecting or transmitting personal data. Internet access is used exclusively for downloading new content.

**5. Changes to This Privacy Policy**

We may update this Privacy Policy in the future, particularly as we plan to integrate analytics features to improve our app's services. Such updates will be communicated through our app and on the Google Play Store page. Please review our Privacy Policy periodically for any changes.

**6. Your Consent**

By using the Soundboard App, you consent to this Privacy Policy. If you do not agree with our policies, please do not download or use our app.

**7. Contact Us**

If you have any questions or concerns about this Privacy Policy or the Soundboard App, please feel free to contact us.

Thank you for choosing the Soundboard App by Tibik. Enjoy a private, secure, and fun experience!
